	Write the decimal equivalent below each digit

	4   f   a
	4   15  10

2. Write 8, 4, 2, 1 below each hex digit. These are powers of 2 for bit
	in the string of 4 binary digits

[ Binary to Hex ]

1. Group binary string into groups of 4
	10101010 = 1010 1010

2. Write 8, 4, 2 and 1 below each group.
	1010	1010
	8421	8421

3. Multiply the 8, 4, 2 and 1’s with the digit above.
	1010	1010
	8421	8421
	____________
	8020	8020

4. Add the products within each set of four.
	8+0+2+0 = 10
	8+0+2+0 = 10

5. Write using hex symbols
	10 = a
	11 = b
	12 = c
	13 = d
	14 = e
	15 = f

[ Microprocessor ]

[ Registers ]

	- One 8-bit pc register
	- One 8-bit instruction register (ir)
	- Nine 4-bit data registers
		ID	 	reg
		000 	x0
		001 	x1
		010 	y0
		011 	y1
		100 	r 		when the ID is used in a source register field
		100 	o_reg 	when the ID is used in a destination register field
		101 	m
		110 	i
		111 	dm 		not a single register, the source or destination is data memory

	- o_reg can only be a destination
	- r can only be a source
	- r is only written on ALU instructions


[ Instructions ]

	- Each instruction is 8 bits
	- Instructions come from the program memory (ROM) and
		are loaded into the instruction register (ir) on
		each rising edge of clk
	- The instruction in the ir is executed on the next
		rising edge of the clk

	sync reset
		- If high, ir is ignored and
			reg_en = 9'h1ff
			source_sel = 4'd10
			i_sel  = 1’b0
			x_sel = 1’b0
			y_sel = 1’b0
			jmp = 1’b0
			jmp_nz  = 1’b0
		- ir must not be cleared

	Load: 0, dst, dst, dst, data, data, data, data

		- Loads dst with the contents of ir
		- ir[7] == 0 specifies a load instruction
		  ir[6 : 4] holds the ID of the destination register
		  ir[3 : 0] is the four bit constant loaded into the destination register

		- Special case: load data memory. If data is dm, then
			i = i + m instruction is also executed simultaneously


	Mov: 1, 0, dst, dst, dst, src, src, src

		- Move contents of src register into dst register
		- ir[7] == 1 and ir[6] == 0 specifies a move (mov) instruction
		  ir[5 : 3] holds the ID of the destination register
		  ir[2 : 0] holds the ID of the source register

		- If src and dst are both 3'h4, then move r to o_reg
		- If src and dst are identical but not 3'h4, then
			move i_pins to dst
		- If dst = dm or if src = dm and dst != i, then i = i + m
			is also executed simultaneously


	Jump: 1, 1, 1, 0, dst, dst, dst, dst

		- Jump to dst (done by program sequencer)
		- No registers enabled for this instruction


	Conditional Jump: 1, 1, 1, 1, dst, dst, dst, dst

		- Jump to dst if the r register is non-zero (done by program sequencer)
		- The contents of r is non-zero if and only if the zero flag is not set
		- No registers enabled for this instruction


	ALU Instructions: 1, 1, 0, x_sel, y_sel, func, func, func

		- ir[7 : 6] == 2’b11 and ir[5] == 1’b0 to specify an ALU instruction
		- x_sel == 0 means x0 is the x operand, x_sel == 1 means x1 is the x operand
		- y_sel == 0 means y0 is the y operand, y_sel == 1 means y1 is the y operand
		- x_sel and y_sel have special cases for single operand instructions

		- There are 8 possible ALU operations specifiable by func

			func	other conditions	operation				description
			--------------------------------------------------------------------

			000 	and y_sel == 0		r = -x					r gets two’s complement of x

			000 	and y_sel == 1		r = r					No operation
										zero_flag = zero_flag	x_sel may be 0 or 1

			001							r = x - y				unsigned subtraction

			010							r = x + y				unsigned addition

			011							r = (x * y) [7:4]		unsigned multiplication. r is
																most significant 4 bits of x*y

			100							r = (x * y) [3:0]		unsigned multiplication. r is
																least significant 4 bits of x*y

			101							r = x ^ y				OR

			110							r = x ^ y				AND

			111 	and y_sel == 0		r = ~x					r gets one's complement of x

			111 	and y_sel == 1		r = r					No operation
										zero_flag = zero_flag	x_sel may be 0 or 1
