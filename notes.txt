[ Creating a New Project ]

- Each question needs its own project
- In Project Type, select Empty Project
- Skip Add Files
- Device family is Cyclone IV E
- Device name is EP4CE115F29C7
- In EDA Tool Settings, for Simulation choose Questa Intel FPGA and Verilog HDL.
    Leave the rest to None
- Click Finish to create the project
- From the Assignments menu at the top, open the Settings.
- Under EDA Tool Settings, in Simulation, click on More EDA Netlist Writer Settings
- Set Generate function simulation netlist to Off
- When adding new files, select SystemVerilog HDL File


[ Creating a New Questasim Project ]

- Use File menu to create new project
- Set the project location to <quartus_project>/simulation/questa
- Project Name can be the same as the verilog module being tested
- Add the main .vo file to the project. This contains the timing model of the circuit
- A .sv file containing the test code will also need to be written


[ Questasim Simulation ]

- Compile the files
- In the Simulate menu, click Start Simulation
- Expand work and select the test file
- Enable optimizations
- In Optimization Options, select Apply full visibility to all modules(full debug mode)
- In the libraries tab, add altera_mf_ver, altera_ver, and cycloneive_ver
- Run simulation




[ Hex to Binary ]

1. Separate each hex digit. It represents a string of 4 binary digits.
    Write the decimal equivalent below each digit

    4   f   a
    4   15  10

2. Write 8, 4, 2, 1 below each hex digit. These are powers of 2 for bit
    in the string of 4 binary digits

    4       f       a
    4       15      10
    8421    8421    8421


3. Determine which powers of two (8, 4, 2 or 1) sum up to hex digits.
    Write 1 below the power that is used and 0 under power that isn't

    4       f       a
    4       15      10
    8421    8421    8421

4. (4FA)16 = (10011111010)2





[ Binary to Hex ]

1. Group binary string into groups of 4
    10101010 = 1010 1010

2. Write 8, 4, 2 and 1 below each group.
    1010	1010
    8421	8421

3. Multiply the 8, 4, 2 and 1â€™s with the digit above.
    1010	1010
    8421	8421
    ____________
    8020	8020

4. Add the products within each set of four.
    8+0+2+0 = 10
    8+0+2+0 = 10

5. Write using hex symbols
    10 = a
    11 = b
    12 = c
    13 = d
    14 = e
    15 = f
