[ Creating a New Project ]

- Each question needs its own project
- In Project Type, select Empty Project
- Skip Add Files
- Device family is Cyclone IV E
- Device name is EP4CE115F29C7
- In EDA Tool Settings, for Simulation choose Questa Intel FPGA and Verilog HDL.
    Leave the rest to None
- Click Finish to create the project
- From the Assignments menu at the top, open the Settings.
- Under EDA Tool Settings, in Simulation, click on More EDA Netlist Writer Settings
- Set Generate function simulation netlist to Off
- When adding new files, select SystemVerilog HDL File


[ Creating a New Questasim Project ]

- Use File menu to create new project
- Set the project location to <quartus_project>/simulation/questa
- Project Name can be the same as the verilog module being tested
- Add the main .vo file to the project. This contains the timing model of the circuit
- A .sv file containing the test code will also need to be written


[ Questasim Simulation ]

- Compile the files
- In the Simulate menu, click Start Simulation
- Expand work and select the test file
- Enable optimizations
- In Optimization Options, select Apply full visibility to all modules(full debug mode)
- In the libraries tab, add altera_mf_ver, altera_ver, and cycloneive_ver
- Run simulation
