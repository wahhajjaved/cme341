/*  NB: It is strongly suggested that this module be organized so that all questions can be answered using a single quartus project.
This can be done by answering the questions in separate modules, perhaps named student_circuit_Q1, student_circuit_Q2, student_circuit_Q3 and student_circuit_Q4, as shown below.
Then one of these modules is instantiated within this module.  For example the answer to question 1, 2, 3, or 4 is answered by uncommenting the instantiation of interest and commenting all others.
